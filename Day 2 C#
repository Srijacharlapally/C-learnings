Variable: A Variable is the name given to the memory location, where the data value of the variable is stored.Unlike constant,the value of a variable can be changed during execution.A Variable name must be chosen in such a way that it is easily readable and understandable.
C# Data type:C# is a strongly-typed language.It means we must declare the type of a variable that indicates the kind of values it is going to store, such as integer, float, decimal, text,etc.
example:
int myNum = 5; -  stores intrgers (whole numbers),without decimals, such as 123 or - 123
double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;  - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or- 19.99
char MYLetter = 'D';  - stores single characters,such as 'a' or 'B' char values are surrounded by single quotes 
string myText = "Hello";  - stores text, such as "Hello World". string values are surrounded by double quotes
bool myBool = true;  - stores values with two states: true or false

Intialization During Variable Declaration
Syntax 
data_type variable_name=value;
Example
int average=50;
char name=srija;

IntialisationUsing an Assignment Stayement 
Syntax 
Example
Average=50;
name=srija;
In C#, initial values to variables can also be assigned as 
int p,q.r;
This statement declares THREE Variables.
int X=5,y=10;
This statement declares and initializes integer variables.
Example program:
class Example 
{
  int p=15;
  static int q=25;
  public static void main()
     {
       int p=150;
       int q=250;
       console.writeLine(p);          //Local variable 
       console.writeLine(q);          //Local variable 
       }
